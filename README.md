### Simplifying RESTful APIs

Waterbase is a tool that helps developers create RESTful APIs through a simple GUI.

Whether you're racing to finish a MVP or want to start crafting an amazing user experience, creating a backend is always a large time sink. Waterbase helps lay the groundwork by providing a tool that generates a simple backend to get you started with what really matters.

Waterbase is also helpful learning tool for beginners by abstracting some complexity while still introducing concepts of data modeling.

To create an API, developers simply fill out a form describing what resources their product needs and press "create server". Just like that, there is a full RESTful API for them to store their data.

No coding necessary.
